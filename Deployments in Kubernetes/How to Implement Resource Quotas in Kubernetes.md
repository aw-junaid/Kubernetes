Implementing Resource Quotas in Kubernetes allows you to set constraints on the amount of resources that pods and containers can use in a namespace. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Create a ResourceQuota

Create a file named `resource-quota.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-resource-quota
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: 8Gi
```

In this example, the ResourceQuota (`my-resource-quota`) is defined with limits on the number of pods, CPU requests, memory requests, CPU limits, and memory limits.

Apply the ResourceQuota:

```bash
kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml
```

## Step 2: Apply the ResourceQuota to a Namespace

To apply the ResourceQuota to a specific namespace, you need to create or modify the namespace.

If you're creating a new namespace, include the `resourceQuotas` section in your namespace YAML file. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-namespace
  labels:
    name: my-namespace
  annotations:
    ...
  resourceQuotas:
  - name: my-resource-quota
    spec:
      hard:
        pods: "10"
        requests.cpu: "4"
        requests.memory: 4Gi
        limits.cpu: "8"
        limits.memory: 8Gi
```

If you want to apply the ResourceQuota to an existing namespace, you can modify it:

```bash
kubectl edit namespace my-namespace
```

Add the `resourceQuotas` section as shown above.

## Step 3: Verify ResourceQuota

You can check the ResourceQuotas in your cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get resourcequotas -n my-namespace
```

This will display the defined quotas and their usage.

## Step 4: Test the ResourceQuota

Deploy pods to the namespace and observe how they interact with the ResourceQuota. For example, try deploying more pods than the specified limit.

## Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

If you want to remove the ResourceQuota:

```bash
kubectl delete resourcequota my-resource-quota -n my-namespace
```

## Tips:

- Customize the ResourceQuota based on your specific requirements for resource usage.

- Monitor your applications to ensure they stay within the defined resource limits.

- Remember that ResourceQuotas only apply to the namespace they are associated with.

Always refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for best practices and advanced configurations when working with ResourceQuotas.
