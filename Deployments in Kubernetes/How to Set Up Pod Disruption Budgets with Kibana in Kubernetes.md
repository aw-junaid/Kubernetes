Setting up Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) with Kibana in Kubernetes involves configuring PDBs and ensuring Kibana components handle disruptions gracefully. Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Prerequisites:

1. **A Running Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running.

2. **Kibana Components**: Set up Kibana components in your cluster. This may include Elasticsearch, Logstash, and any other components in your ELK stack.

## Step 1: Create a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)

1. **Define the PDB**:

   Create a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) YAML file (for example, `pdb.yaml`) with the following content:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
   kind: PodDisruptionBudget
   metadata:
     name: kibana-pdb
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: kibana
     maxUnavailable: 1
   ```

   In this example, we're allowing a maximum of 1 unavailable pod at a time. Make sure to replace `app: kibana` with the appropriate label selector for your Kibana pods.

   Apply the PDB definition:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f pdb.yaml
   ```

## Step 2: Verify PDB and Kibana Components

1. **View Pod Disruption Budget**:

   Check if the Pod Disruption Budget is applied:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pdb kibana-pdb
   ```

2. **Verify Kibana Pods**:

   Ensure that the Kibana pods are running without any disruptions:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app=kibana
   ```

## Notes:

- Customize the Pod Disruption Budget according to your specific requirements.

- Always refer to the official documentation of Kubernetes and Kibana for best practices and advanced configurations.

Remember that this is a simplified guide, and actual configurations may vary based on your specific environment and requirements. Always refer to the official documentation for Kubernetes, Kibana, and related tools for best practices and advanced configurations.
